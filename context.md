[Task]
- Fix the coordinate mapping between the GUI and our motion detection script

[Breakdown]

- InteractiveChessboard : 
0: 
"4,-7"
1: 
"542,-9"
2: 
"540,531"
3: 
"5,533"

- InteractiveChessboardOld : 
0: 
"4,2"
1: 
"538,4"
2: 
"540,525"
3: 
"5,526"

- yeah, we can conclude that both components used the same coordinate system, the difference is marginal
